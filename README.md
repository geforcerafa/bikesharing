## Overview of Project

After a trip to New York City, it was realized that bike sharing is a great idea. There is the possibility to bring the idea to Des Moines, Iowa. The first step is to analyze how it works in NYC, and then take that analysis to Des Moines, to see how it could be adapted. 

Some of the questions that were answered in were:
•	The number of trips made in the month of August. 
•	The segmentation of users by gender.
•	The status of users by subscriber or customer.
•	Locate the top starting and ending locations. 
•	Analysis of the bike utilization, bike repair. 
•	The average trip duration by gender, day of the week, hour, and if the user is customer or subscriber.


### Resources used:
-	Data Sources: 201908-citibike-tripdata.csv
-	Software: Tableau, Jupiter Notebook, Python.


## Results:

In the next picture we can see some of the data visualizations made.

This Dashboard presents some key metrics of Citi Bike. For example, in the month of August there were 2,344,224 rides. The majority of users were males, as it can be seen in the Gender Breakdown. And most of the rides started in the island of Manhattan.

In the Checkout Time Dashboard, we have two types of analysis. In the first one we can se how many bikes were out during what amounts of time. In the second one we have that information breakdown by gender.

The User Trips Dashboard shows the number of rides in each hour, for every day of the week. The busiest hours in weekdays are around 8 am and 5-6 pm. For the Gender unknown is Saturdays, this could be an indication they are tourists.

In the final Dashboard, we can see that the largest number of trips for females and males, during week days, are around 8 am and later at night around 5 pm and 6 pm, it very well be to go and come back from work. In the case of weekend, the busiest hours are around mid-day.

Image Trips by Gender Dashboard



We can see that the largest number of sus trips for females and males, during week days, are around 8 am and later at night around 5 pm and 6 pm, it very well be to go and come back from work. In the case of weekend, the busiest hours are around mid-day.



## Summary:

The goal of this project is to analyze how the bike-sharing company citi-bike works in New York City. What we are looking for is to understand this business to then see how can it be implemented in Des Moines, Iowa. 

Our starting point is a CSV file with the data of citi-bike for the month of August. Key metrics of the business were analyzed like number of trips in a month. Segmentation of users by gender. Location of the top starting and ending locations. Status of users by subscriber or customer. As well as the average trip duration by gender, day of the week, hour, and if the user is customer or subscriber. The deep understanding of this project is going to be used for other cities.



### Additional recommendations:

•	For additional visualizations I would dig dipper into the customer’s segment. If they are in a specific region, may be tourists or they are residents that haven’t become subscribers. This could lead to a campaign to get those customers into a subscription plan and may be increase their use of city-bike. 

•	Other additional visualization that could be very useful for the operation and logistics of the company would be a daily balance of inflows – outflows per station of bikes. This would help to visualize which stations have round trips and which ones don’t, so bikes can be brought to them.
